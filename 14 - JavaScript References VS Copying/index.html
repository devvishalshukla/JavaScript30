    let num2 = num;
    console.log(num, num2);
    num = 20;
    console.log(num, num2);

    let name = 'vishal';

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];
    
    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    const team = players;
    console.log(players, team)
    // however what happens when we update that array?
    players.push('De Gea');
    players[2] = 'Valdes';
    console.log(players, team)

    // now here is the problem!
    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!
    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way
    const team2 = players.slice();
    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players)
    console.log(team2, team3);

    players[2] = 'tech';
    console.log(team2, team3);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players]
    console.log(team4)

    const team5 = Array.from(players);
    console.log(team5)

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const dev = person;
    // console.log(person, dev)
    dev.number = 01;
    // console.log(person, dev)
    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const dev2 = Object.assign({}, person, {number : 22})
    console.log(person, dev)
    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
    const vishal = {
      name : 'Vishal',
      age : 21,
      social : {
        github : 'devvishal',
        linkedin: 'Vishal=shukla'
      }
    }

    const devCpy = Object.assign({}, vishal);

    // Object.assign() works for 1 level copy 
    // If we try to update the data of 2nd level in object or object member within object than those changes are reflected in original object as well
    // for eg. if we try to change the github username in copied objevt than that change would be reflected in original object as well
